# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project explores a **Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset** using **Python**.  
The main goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to **sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep disorders**, and how they are influenced by **demographics and lifestyle factors**.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze sleep duration trends across different age groups  
- Examine relationships between **BMI, stress, physical activity**, and sleep quality  
- Investigate the distribution of sleep disorders  
- Explore gender-based differences in sleep behavior  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features such as age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress level, BMI category, and sleep disorders.  

This data enables analysis of how different factors influence sleep patterns and overall lifestyle.

---

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and is publicly available for learning and analysis purposes.  
All data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations were performed independently.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – data visualization  

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized column names (lowercase, snake_case)  
- Handled missing values and filled missing `sleep_disorder` entries with `"None"`  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Verified data types and summary statistics  
- Created derived features, e.g., rounded sleep duration  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Descriptive Analysis
- Summary statistics for numerical features  
- Frequency distributions for categorical features  

### Visualizations
- **Line plot:** Average sleep duration across age  
- **Scatter plot + regression:** Sleep duration vs age trend  
- **Bar plot:** Quality of sleep by BMI category  
- **Pie chart:** Distribution of sleep disorders  

These visualizations highlight trends, correlations, and patterns in sleep behavior.
## Key Insights
- Sleep duration varies with age  
- BMI category affects quality of sleep  
- Most participants report no sleep disorder  
- Lifestyle and health indicators show meaningful patterns with sleep outcomes
